The purpose of this test is to build a simple Ruby on Rails application that allows
to search for available rooms in host families.

There are 3 files containing data that must be imported into the system:

- hosts-2000.csv

    List of host families defined by the following attributes:

    ref: Unique identifier for that host
    name: Name of the host
    address: Address of the host

- rooms-2000.csv

    List of rooms for each one of the hosts, defined by the following attributes:

    ref: Unique identifier for the room
    host_ref: Identifier of the host the room belongs to
    capacity: Number of people that can sleep in the room

- bookings-2000.csv

    List of bookings already made for the rooms, defined by:

    ref: Unique identifier for the booking
    room_ref: Identifier of the booked room
    start_date: Start date of the booking with format 'yyyy-mm-dd'
    end_date: End date of the booking with format 'yyyy-mm-dd'
    number_of_guests: Number of guests staying in the room for that booking


Deliver a Rails application including the following functionality:

  * Rake task to import the files hosts-2000.csv, rooms-2000.csv and bookings-2000.csv
  * Search the availability of hosts/rooms for a period with input fields:
    - Start date: day, month and year
    - End date: day, month and year
    - Number of guests: integer

    It should return a list of hosts which have rooms available for that period
    and that number of guests (in the same room), showing which rooms are available
    for that host and period and if those rooms already have any guests in any days within that period.
    Paginate results, show 5 hosts per page.

The specific format of the url should be:
    /hosts/search?start_date=yyyy-mm-dd&end_date=yyyy-mm-dd&guests=x

For example, for the data provided in hosts-2000.csv, rooms-2000.csv and bookings-2000.csv

http://localhost:3000/hosts/search?start_date=2013-06-01&end_date=2013-06-07&guests=1

should return:

Search results between 2013-06-01 and 2013-06-07 for 1 guest

host#1: Mr Host 1
1 Camden Street
room#1 is available (1 booked, 1 free out of 2 total)
room#2 is available (0 booked, 2 free out of 2 total)

host#2: Mr Host 2
2 Camden Street
room#4 is available (0 booked, 2 free out of 2 total)

host#4: Mr Host 4
4 Camden Street
room#8 is available (0 booked, 2 free out of 2 total)

host#5: Mr Host 5
5 Camden Street
room#9 is available (1 booked, 1 free out of 2 total)
room#10 is available (0 booked, 2 free out of 2 total)

host#6: Mr Host 6
6 Camden Street
room#12 is available (0 booked, 2 free out of 2 total)

A description of how the problem was solved will be included with any possible considerations and instructions to
run the application and load the data.
